/*
    In order to sample an arbitrary mathematical function of one real variable,
    we function pointer type that accepts an arbitrary context along with
    the independent variable.
    The context is used to hold whatever parameters are needed to evaluate
    the function.  In the case of ephemeris resampling, the context will
    include the solar system body identifier.
    The function stores the N-dimensional vector result of its calculation
    at the array indicated by the third parameter 'double[CHEB_MAX_DIM]'.
    The function returns 0 on success, nonzero on error.
    This is needed because ephemeris functions can return errors.
